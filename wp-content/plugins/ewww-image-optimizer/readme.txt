Reduce file sizes for images within WordPress including NextGEN, GRAND FlAGallery and more. Uses jpegtran, optipng, pngout, pngquant, and gifsicle.

== Description ==

The EWWW Image Optimizer is a WordPress plugin that will automatically and losslessly optimize your images as you upload them to your blog. It can also optimize the images that you have already uploaded in the past. It is also possible to convert your images automatically to the file format that will produce the smallest image size (make sure you read the WARNINGS). It can also optionally apply lossy reductions for PNG images.

By default, EWWW Image Optimizer uses lossless optimization techniques, so your image quality will be exactly the same before and after the optimization. The only thing that will change is your file size. The one small exception to this is GIF animations. While the optimization is technically lossless, you will not be able to properly edit the animation again without performing an --unoptimize operation with gifsicle. The gif2png and jpg2png conversions are also lossless but the png2jpg process is not lossless. Lossy optimization is available for PNG files. While pngquant tries very hard to maintain visual quality, lossy compression always has the potential for quality loss.

Images are optimized using the [jpegtran](http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/), [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/), [pngout](http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm), [pngquant](http://pngquant.org/), and [gifsicle](http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) image tools (available for free). For PNG files, optipng or pngout can be used for lossless compression, and pngquant is available for lossy compression. If you want the best optimization, install all three, set optipng to level 3 (beyond that is just crazy and rarely yields significant gains) and pngout to level 0. Images are converted using the above tools and GD or 'convert' (ImageMagick).

EWWW Image Optimizer calls optimization utilities directly which is well suited to shared hosting situations where these utilities may already be installed. Pre-compiled binaries/executables are provided for optipng, gifsicle, and jpegtran. Pngout can be installed with one-click from the settings page. If none of that works, there is a cloud option that will work for those who cannot run the optimizers on their own server.

**Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?**

1. **Your pages will load faster.** Smaller image sizes means faster page loads. This will make your visitors happy, and can increase ad revenue.
1. **Faster backups.** Smaller image sizes also means faster backups.
1. **Less bandwidth usage.** Optimizing your images can save you hundreds of KB per image, which means significantly less bandwidth usage.
1. **Super fast.** The plugin can run on your own server, so you don’t have to wait for a third party service to receive, process, and return your images. You can optimize hundreds of images in just a few minutes. PNG files take the longest, but you can adjust the settings for your situation.
1. **Better PNG optimization.** You can use pngout, optipng, and pngquant in conjunction.
1. **Root access not needed** Pre-compiled binaries are made available to install directly within the Wordpress folder, and cloud optimization is provided for those who cannot run the binaries locally.
1. **Optimize almost anything** Using the Optimize More tool, and the wp_image_editor class extension, nearly any image in Wordpress can be optimized.

If you need a version of this plugin for cloud use only, see [EWWW Image Optimizer Cloud](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer-cloud/). It is much more compact as it does not contain any binaries or any mention of the exec() function.

= WP Image Editor = 

All images created by the new WP_Image_Editor class in WP 3.5 will be automatically optimized. Current implementations are GD, Imagick, and Gmagick. Images optimized via this class include Meta Slider, BuddyPress Activity Plus (thumbs), WP Retina 2x, Imsanity, Simple Image Sizes and probably countless others. If you have a plugin that uses WP_Image_Editor and would like EWWW IO to be able to optimize previous uploads, post a thread in the support forums.

= Optimize Almost Everything =

As of version 1.7.0, site admins can specify any folder within their wordpress folder to be optimized. The 'Scan and Optimize' option under Media->Bulk Optimize will optimize theme images, BuddyPress avatars, BuddyPress Activity Plus images, Meta Slider slides, WP Symposium images, GD bbPress attachments, and any user-specified folders. Additionally, this tool can run on an hourly basis via wp_cron to keep newly uploaded images optimized. Any images optimized are stored in the database so that the optimizer does not attempt to re-optimize them unless they are modified (and so you can take a look at the table to see what exactly is being optimized).

= NextGEN Gallery =

Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The NextGEN Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the NextGEN menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.
NOTE: Does not optimize thumbnails on initial upload for legacy (1.9.x) versions of NextGEN, but instead provides a button to optimize thumbnails after uploading images.

= GRAND Flash Album Gallery =

Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the FlAGallery menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.

= Image Store =

Uploads are automatically optimized. Look for Optimize under the Image Store (Galleries) menu to see status of optimization and for re-optimization and bulk-optimization options. Using the Bulk Optimization tool under Media Library automatically includes all Image Store uploads.

= Translations =

Translators: 
Romanian translation by MediasInfo.ro.
Spanish translation by Andrew Kurtis of WebHostingHub.
Dutch translation by Ludo Rubben.

1. Please post in the support forums announcing your intent to translate the plugin into a particular language. 
1. Download ewww-image-optimizer.pot from the plugin /languages/ folder.
1. Fill in the msgstr for each msgid and complete the header information as best as you can (recommended to use PoEdit).
1. Save it as a .po file.
1. Submit it via the form at http://www.shanebishop.net/contact-me/


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'ewww-image-optimizer' plugin to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Ensure jpegtran, optipng, pngout and gifsicle are installed on your Linux server (basic installation instructions are below if they are not). You will receive a warning when you activate the plugin if they are not present. This message will go away once you have them installed.
1. The plugin will attempt to install jpegtran, optipng, and gifsicle automatically for you. This requires that the wp-content folder is writable by the user running the web server.
1. If the automatic install did not work, find the appropriate binaries for your system in the ewww-image-optimizer plugin folder, copy them to wp-content/ewww/ and remove the OS 'tag' (like -linux or -fbsd). No renaming is necessary on Windows, just copy the .exe files to the wp-content/ewww folder. IMPORTANT: Do not symlink or modify the binaries in any way, or they will not pass the security checks. If you transfer files via FTP, be sure to transfer in binary mode, not ascii or text.
1. If the binaries don't run locally, you can sign up for the EWWW IO cloud service to run them via a third-party server: http://www.exactlywww.com/cloud/
1. *Optional* Visit the settings page to enable/disable specific tools and turn on advanced optimization features.
1. Done!

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NKBfmE00vM]

= Installing pngout =

Pngout is not enabled by default because it is resource intensive. Optipng is the preferred PNG optimizer if you have resource (CPU) constraints. Pngout is also not open-source for those who care about such things, but the command-line version is free.

1. Go to the settings page.
1. Uncheck the option to disable pngout and Save your settings.
1. Click the link in the Plugin Status area to install pngout for your server, and the plugin will download the pngout archive, unpack it, and install the appropriate version for your server.
1. Adjust the pngout level according to your needs. Level 0 gives the best results, but can take up to a minute or more on a single image.

= Installing optipng =

1. Optipng is now bundled with the plugin. If it isn't working for some reason, keep going...
1. If you have root access to your server, you can install optipng from the standard repositories (yum/rpm or apt/deb). If you are on shared hosting, read on... These steps can/should generally all be done via the command line
1. Download the latest stable version of [optipng](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) to your home directory
1. Ensure libpng and zlib are installed. If they are not, you're on your own there (but maybe you need a new web host...)
1. Uncompress optipng: *tar xvzf optipng-0.7.4.tar.gz && cd optipng-0.7.4*
1. Configure and compile optipng: *./configure && make*
1. If you have root access, install it with *make install*
1. If not, copy the binary from */optipng-0.7.4/src/optipng/optipng* to the ewww tool folder (wordpress/wp-content/ewww/optipng-custom).

= Installing jpegtran =

1. Jpegtran is now bundled with the plugin. If it isn't working for some reason, keep going...
1. If you have root access to your server, jpegtran is part of the libjpeg-turbo-progs on Debian/Ubuntu, and likely something similar on rpm distros (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, SuSE). If you are on shared hosting, read on... These steps can/should generally all be done via the command line
1. Download the latest stable version of [jpegtran](http://www.ijg.org/) to your home directory
1. Uncompress jpegtran: *tar xvzf jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz && cd jpeg-9*
1. Configure and compile jpegtran: *./configure --disable-shared && make*
1. If you have root access, install it with *make install*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin replace existing images? =

Yes, but only if the optimized version is smaller. The plugin should NEVER create a larger image.

= Can I resize my images with this plugin? =

No, that would be a lossy operation, and we try to avoid that. Use Imsanity.

= Can I lower the compression setting for JPGs to save more space? =

Again, that would be a lossy operation, and we try to avoid that. Use Imsanity.

= The bulk optimizer doesn't seem to be working, what can I do? =

Each image is given 50 seconds to complete (which actually doesn't include time used by the optimization utilities). If that doesn't seem to do the trick, you can also increase the setting max_execution_time in your php.ini file. That said, there are other timeouts with Apache, and possibly other limitations of your webhost. If you've tried everything else, the last thing to look for is large PNG files. In my tests on a shared hosting setup, "large" is anything over 300 KB. You can first try decreasing the PNG optimization level in the settings. If that doesn't work, perhaps you ought to convert that PNG to JPG. Screenshots are often done as PNG files, but that is a poor choice for anything with photographic elements.

= What are the supported operating systems? =

I've tested it on Windows (with Apache), Linux, Mac OSX, FreeBSD, and Solaris (v10). The cloud service will run on any OS.

= How are JPGs optimized? =

Using the command *jpegtran -copy all -optimize -progressive -outfile optimized-file original-file*. Optionally, the -copy switch gets the 'none' parameter if you choose to strip metadata from your JPGs on the options page.

= How are PNGs optimized? =

There are three parts (and all are optional). First, using the command *pngquant original-file*, then using the commands *pngout-static -s2 original-file* and *optipng -o2 original-file*. You can adjust the optimization levels for both tools on the settings page. Optipng is an automated derivative of pngcrush, which is another widely used png optimization utility.

= How are GIFs optimized? =

Using the command *gifsicle -b -O3 --careful original file*. This is particularly useful for animated GIFs, and can also streamline your color palette. That said, if your GIF is not animated, you should strongly consider converting it to a PNG. PNG files are almost always smaller, they just don't do animations. The following command would do this for you on a Linux system with imagemagick: *convert somefile.gif somefile.png*

= Why not just convert GIFs to PNGs then? =

Go for it, version 1.2+ makes this possible so long as you have either one of the PNG optimizers available.

= I want to know more about image optimization, and why you chose these options/tools. =

That's not a question, but since I made it up, I'll answer it. See the Image Optimization sections for [Yslow - Yahoo](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#opt_images) and [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/payload#CompressImages). Pngout was suggested by a user and in tests optimizes better than Optipng, and best (usually) when they are used together.

== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin settings page.
2. Additional optimize column added to media listing. You can see your savings, manually optimize individual images, and restore originals (converted only).
3. Bulk optimization page. You can optimize all your images at once and resume a previous bulk optimization. This is very useful for existing blogs that have lots of images.

= 1.0.9 =
* fixed parse error due to php short tags (old habits die hard)

= 1.0.8 =
* added extra progress and time indicators on Bulk Optimize
* allow each image in Bulk Optimize 50 seconds to help prevent timeouts (doesn't work if PHP's Safe Mode is turned on)

= 1.0.5 =
* missed documentation updates in 1.0.4 - sorry

= 1.0.4 =
* Added trial with -progressive switch for JPGs (jpegtran), thanks to Alex Vojacek for noticing something was missing. We still check to make sure the progressive option is better, just in case.
* tested against 3.4-RC3

= 1.0.3 =
* Allow user to specify PNG optimization level
* Code and screenshot cleanup
* Settings page beautification (if you can think of further improvements, feel free to use the support link)

* First release (forked from CW Image Optimizer)

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.8.2 = 
* All cloud users must apply this update to avoid service degradation

= 1.8.0 =
* Bulk Optimize page: Import to the custom ewwwio table is mandatory (one time) before running Bulk Optimize, and highly recommended for all users to prevent duplicate optimizations. Optimize More and Bulk Optimize are now on one page.

= 1.7.6 =
* metadata stripping now applies to PNG images, but only if using optipng 0.7.x, you may want to run a bulk optimize on all your PNG images to make sure you have the best possible optimization

= 1.7.5 =
* New version of gifsicle that has quite a few improvements. If you have restricted permissions on the wp-content/ewww/ folder, you may need to temporarily change them to allow the plugin to perform the gifsicle upgrade automatically.

= 1.7.2 =
* Optimize More table format has changed, make sure to visit Optimize More and Convert your table immediately after upgrade if you are running it in scheduled mode.

= 1.7.0 =
* More third-party plugins supported via custom paths, and the Optimize More tool (which can also run via cron now). Also check out new screencasts on the Installation page.

= 1.6.2 =
* All Cloud users should upgrade immediately to avoid extended page load times

= 1.6.1 =
* New Cloud Optimization option for those who can't (or won't) enable exec() on their servers (BETA: get your free API key at http://www.exactlywww.com/cloud/)

= 1.5.0 =
Fixes and enhancements for NextGEN 2, Buddypress support, and theme image optimization

= 1.4.4 =
bugfix release for nextgen users only, everyone else can ignore this release

= 1.4.0 =
sorry about the accidental release of 1.3.9, use this one instead

= 1.3.7 =
If you are using 1.3.6 without problems, you can safely ignore 1.3.7. It is a compatibility fix only.

= 1.3.0 =
Removed path options, moved optimizers to wp-content/ewww. Requires write permissions on the wp-content folder. Custom compiled binaries should automatically be moved to the wp-content/ewww folder also.

= 1.2.1 =
SECURITY: bundled optipng is 0.7.4 to address a vulnerability. Fixed invalid missing tools warning. Added conversion operations gif2png, png2jpg, and jpg2png. Setting paths manually will be disabled in a future release, as the plugin now automatically looks in the plugin folder.

= 1.1.0 =
Added pngout functionality for even better PNG optimization (disabled by default). Settings page now has links to stand-alone binaries of gifsicle and optipng. Please try them out and report any problems.

= 1.0.11 =
Added resume function if Bulk Optimization fails

= 1.0.7 =
Enhanced NextGEN integration, and security enhancements for user data provided to exec() command

= 1.0.6 =
Made jpeg optimization safer (so an empty file doesn't overwrite the originals), and added NextGEN Gallery integration

= 1.0.5 =
Improved optimization for JPGs significantly, by adding -progressive flag. May want to run the bulk operation on all your JPGs (or your whole library)

= 1.0.1 =
Improved performance for PNGs by specifying proper optimization level
